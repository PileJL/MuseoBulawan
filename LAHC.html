Initially, these irons were constructed using metal materials such as cast iron or iron. They featured a singular structure with a hinged lid at the back, allowing for easy opening and closing. To generate the required heat for ironing, these irons were placed in hot coals. Additionally, a wooden handle was affixed to the top of the lid, serving as a protective measure to prevent burns while handling the iron during the ironing process.</b>

        <p class = "heroe2_name">JOSE MARIA E. PANGANIBAN<br><span style = "font-family: 'Sukar Black'; font-size: 2.7vw;">(1863-1890)</span></p>
        <p class = "heroe2_txt"><b>On December 1, 1934, Act No. 4155 renamed the mining town of Mambulao, Camarines Norte to Maria Panganiban in honor of the great propagandist who died in Spain while in pursuit of reforms in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. <br>
            Jose Maria Panganiban was born in Mambulao, Camarines on February 1, 1863. He was the eldest of the three sons of Vicente Panganiban, a native of Hagonoy, Bulacan and Juana Enverga, a native of Mauban, Tayabas (now Quezon).<br>
            Panganiban developed his interest in reading at an early age from reading the cartilla, caton and catecismo taught by his mother. Once, his mother found him under a tree, sleeping obviously from reading Don Quixote, the book of Cervantes, found beside him.<br>
            Since his mother died when he was a little boy, Panganiban grew up in the care of his father, the clerk of court in Daet, the capital town of the province. His father sent him to the seminary of Nueva Caceres (now Naga) and became the protégé of the seminary rector Fr. Santonja. <br>
            He earned the praises of his teachers because of his aptitude to easily absorb his lessons. He was good at writing and was articulate in expressing his ideas. Because of this, the Spanish Governor-General Domingo Moriones who happened to be visiting the province and heard him speak during a school program commended him. <br>
            In April 1878, he wrote A Nuestro Obispo in honor of Bishop Francisco Gainza who was on a visit to Mambulao. Father Santoja became instrumental for Panganiban’s studies in Manila. The priest recommended him to the College of San Juan de Letran where he obtained his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1883. <br>
            Wanting to become a medical practitioner, he took up medical courses at the University of Santo Tomas and at the same time taking vocational courses in agriculture at Letran so that in 1885, he received the title of Agricultural Expert.<br>
            Panganiban participated in literary scientific contests at the UST and earned prizes. The first was in 1885 when he won second place. In 1887, he won first prized for each of his three papers on General Pathology, Therapeutics and Surgical Anatomy. <br>
            Fr. Gregorio Echevarria, the rector of the University, had his works printed and exhibited in the Exposition of 1887 in Madrid. In May 1888, Panganiban sailed for Spain and continued his medical studies at the
            University of Barcelona, where he met other Filipino students. <br>
            Drawn to the propaganda movement, Panganiban quit his dream of becoming a doctor. He joined liberal organizations like the Asociacion Hispano-Filipino and the La Solidaridad that both of which aimed for reforms in the Philippines. <br>
            On April 25, 1889, Panganiban was one of the signers of the petition to the Spanish Minister of Colonies, requesting for Filipino representation in the Spanish Cortes. While in Spain, he learned other languages like German, Italian, and French, adding to the Spanish and Latin he learned during his student days in the seminary of Nueva Caceres. He was able to translate into Spanish the book of German author Carl Julius Weber entitled: Die Religio und Die Religionen.
